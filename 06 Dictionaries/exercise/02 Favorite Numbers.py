# Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers. Think of five
# names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite number for each person,
# and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print each person’s name and their favorite
# number. For even more fun, poll a few friends and get some actual data for your program.
