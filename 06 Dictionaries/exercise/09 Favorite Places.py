# Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use
# as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person. To make this
# exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places. Loop
# through the dictionary, and print each personâ€™s name and their favorite places.
