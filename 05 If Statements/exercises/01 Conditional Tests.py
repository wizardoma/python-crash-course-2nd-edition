# Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing eachtest and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
# car = 'subaru'
# print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
# print(car == 'subaru')
# print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
# print(car == 'audi')
# Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why
# each line evaluates to True or False.
# Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and
# another five tests evaluate to False.
