# A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods. Think of five simple foods,
# and store them in a tuple.

# Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers.

# Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects
# the change.

# The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with
# different foods. Add a line that rewrites the tuple, and then use a
# for loop to print each of the items on the revised menu.

foods = ("rice","burger","cinamon","tea","garri")

for f in foods:
    print(f)

# foods[0] = "Soup"


foods = ("soup","pizza","cinamon","tea","garri")

for f in foods:
    print(f)
