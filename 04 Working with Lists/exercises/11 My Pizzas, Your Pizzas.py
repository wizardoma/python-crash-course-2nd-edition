# Add a new pizza to the original list.

# Add a different pizza to the list friend_pizzas.

# Prove that you have two separate lists. Print the message My
# favorite pizzas are:, and then use a for loop to print the first list.

# Print the message My friendâ€™s favorite pizzas are:, and then use a for
# loop to print the second list. Make sure each new pizza is stored in
# the appropriate list
