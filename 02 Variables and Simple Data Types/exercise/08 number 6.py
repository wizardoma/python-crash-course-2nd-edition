# Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that
# each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print() calls to see the
# results. You should create four lines that look like this:

addition = 5 + 3
subtraction = 10 - 2
division = 16 / 2
multiplication =  8 * 1;

print(f"Addition: {addition}")
print(f"Substraction: {subtraction}")
print(f"Division: {division}")
print(f"Multiplication: {multiplication}")
