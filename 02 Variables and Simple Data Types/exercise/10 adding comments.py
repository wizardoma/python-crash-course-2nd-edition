# Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one
# comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too
# simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.
# Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

 # THis is exercise 01 in this chapter. The program just prints name
message = "Ibekason Alexander Onyebuchi"

print(message)


# This is exercise 02. It reassigns value to a previously used variable
message = "I am learning python"
print(message)
message = "I mean python 3"
print(message)
